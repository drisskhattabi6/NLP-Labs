# Scraping and NLP Pipeline For Arabic Text

## Scraping and NLP Pipeline for Arabic Web Sources

### Objective
The objective of this project is to gain familiarity with scraping and NLP pipeline techniques. Specifically, we aim to scrape data from Arabic web sources related to a specific domain, store the raw data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB), and then establish an NLP pipeline including text cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, discretization, normalization, stemming, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging using rule-based and machine learning approaches, and named entity recognition (NER) methods.

### Work Summary

1. **Scraping Arabic Web Sources :**
   We utilized libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup for scraping Arabic web sources relevant to the chosen domain. This involved identifying appropriate websites, extracting relevant content, and handling Arabic text encoding and parsing challenges.

2. **Storing Data in MongoDB :**
   The scraped raw data was stored in MongoDB, a NoSQL database. MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing unstructured data, making it suitable for our purposes.

3. **NLP Pipeline :**
   - **Text Cleaning:** This step involved removing noise from the text, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and non-Arabic characters.
   - **Tokenization:** Arabic text was tokenized into individual words or tokens.
   - **Stop Words Removal:** Common Arabic stop words were removed to focus on meaningful content.
   - **Discretization:** The text was discretized to convert continuous values into discrete categories if applicable.
   - **Normalization:** Text normalization techniques like removing diacritics and normalization of characters were applied to ensure consistency in representation.
   - **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Both stemming and lemmatization techniques were applied to reduce words to their base forms. Stemming is rule-based and may result in the creation of non-words, while lemmatization ensures words are reduced to their dictionary form.
   - **Parts of Speech Tagging:** Parts of speech were tagged using both rule-based and machine learning approaches to identify the grammatical category of each word in the text.
   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** NER methods were applied to identify and classify named entities such as persons, organizations, locations, etc., in the text.

4. **Stemming vs. Lemmatization :**
   Stemming reduces words to their root form based on rules without considering the context, which can lead to inaccuracies and the creation of non-words. Lemmatization, on the other hand, maps words to their dictionary form, considering the context and linguistic morphology. While stemming is computationally faster, lemmatization generally provides more accurate results.

5. **Parts of Speech Tagging :**
   Parts of speech tagging helps in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences. Rule-based approaches rely on predefined grammatical rules, while machine learning approaches use annotated training data to predict parts of speech based on contextual information. Each approach has its advantages and limitations depending on the complexity of the language and the availability of annotated data.

6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) :**
   NER is a subtask of information extraction that aims to identify and classify named entities mentioned in text into predefined categories such as persons, organizations, locations, etc. Various methods such as rule-based systems, statistical models, and deep learning techniques can be employed for NER depending on the requirements and available resources.

### Conclusion
   This project provided valuable insights into scraping and NLP pipeline techniques for Arabic text. By utilizing libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup for scraping, and employing various NLP techniques including stemming, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, and named entity recognition, we were able to process and analyze Arabic text from web sources effectively. The comparison between stemming and lemmatization highlighted the importance of considering linguistic context for accurate text processing. Additionally, the application of NER methods demonstrated the capability to extract valuable information from unstructured text data. Overall, this project serves as a foundational step towards building more advanced NLP applications for Arabic language processing.
